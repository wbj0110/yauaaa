<p><strong>Work</strong> shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</p>
<p><strong>Contribution</strong> shall mean any work of authorship, including
the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

<p><strong>Contributor</strong> shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

<h2 id="grant-of-copyright-license">Grant of Copyright License.</h2>
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>
<h2 id="grant-of-patent-license">Grant of Patent License.</h2>
<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
<h2 id="redistribution">Redistribution.</h2>
<p>You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
<p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that You changed the files; and</p>
<p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
    the Derivative Works; and</p>
<p>(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
    as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p>
<h2 id="submission-of-contributions-unless-you-explicitly-state-otherwise">Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</h2>
<p>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
<h2 id="trademarks">Trademarks.</h2>
<p>This License does not grant permission to use the trade
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
<h2 id="disclaimer-of-warranty">Disclaimer of Warranty.</h2>
<p>Unless required by applicable law or
agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
<h2 id="limitation-of-liability-in-no-event-and-under-no-legal-theory">Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</h2>
<p>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<h2 id="accepting-warranty-or-additional-liability">Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.</h2>
<p>While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
